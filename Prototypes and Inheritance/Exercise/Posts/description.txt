You need to create several classes for Posts.
Implement the following classes:
â€¢	Post, which is initialized with the title (String) and content (String)
o	The 2 arguments should be public members
o	The Post class should also have toString() function which returns the following result:
"Post: {postTitle}"
"Content: {postContent}"

SocialMediaPost, which inherits the Post class and should be initialized with 2 additional arguments - likes (Number) and dislikes (Number). The class should hold:
o	comments(Strings) -  an array of strings
o	addComment(comment)- a function, which adds comments to that array
o	The class should extend the toString() function of the Post class, and should return the following result:
"Post: {postTitle}"
"Content: {postContent}"
"Rating: {postLikes - postDislikes}"
"Comments:"
" * {comment1}"
" * {comment2}"
. . .
In case there are no comments, return information only about the title, content, and rating of the post.

BlogPost, which inherits the Post class:
o	The BlogPost class should be initialized with 1 additional argument - views(Number).
o	The BlogPost class should hold 
- view() - which increments the views of the object with 1, every time it is called. 
The function should return the object so that chaining is supported.

o	The BlogPost class should extend the toString() function of the Post class, and should return the following result:
"Post: {postTitle}"
"Content: {postContent}"
"Views: {postViews}"
