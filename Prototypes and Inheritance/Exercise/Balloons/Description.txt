You have been tasked to create several classes for balloons.

Implement a class Balloon, which is initialized with a color (String) and gasWeight (Number).

These two arguments should be public members.

Implement another class PartyBalloon, which inherits the Balloon class and is initialized
with 2 additional parameters - ribbonColor (String) and ribbonLength (Number).

The PartyBalloon class should have a property ribbon, 
which is an object with color and length - the ones given upon initialization. 

The ribbon property should have a getter.

Implement another class BirthdayBalloon, which inherits the PartyBalloon class 
and is initialized with 1 extra parameter - text (String). 

The text should be a property and should have a getter.
